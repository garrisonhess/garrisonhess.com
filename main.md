## Garrison Hess

I'm an M.S. Candidate in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon, specializing in machine learning and systems.  I spent two years as a Data Scientist at [Hookit][1] after my undergraduate degree.  Since then I have returned to school to pursue my MS in Computer Science.  I enjoy baseball, cooking, and Ms. Pac-Man.
